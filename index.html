            <p>
                Homelessness is a pressing issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Lack of stable housing impacts not only individuals but also communities and society at large. This campaign aims to shed light on the realities of homelessness, break the stigma surrounding it, and encourage actions to create meaningful change.

                We strive to connect people with resources, raise awareness about the root causes of homelessness, and promote efforts to combat it through collaboration and compassion. Join us in making a difference and helping to build a future where everyone has a place to call home.

            <h2 class="intro-title">Our Logo</h2>
            <p>
                Our logo is a reflection of Homeward Bound's mission and values, with every element thoughtfully designed to represent hope, love, and action.

 The Meaning of Red:
Red is the dominant color in our logo, symbolizing passion, energy, and the urgency of our mission. It represents the strong emotional connection we have to our cause and the drive to act swiftly and decisively to make a difference. Red also reflects the warmth of a home and the love that binds us together as a community.

 Hands of Support:
The open hands symbolize compassion, solidarity, and the power of collective action. They remind us that addressing homelessness is not a task for one but a shared responsibility for all.

 The House with a Heart:
At the center is a house, representing stability, safety, and belonging—the essential elements of a home. The heart within the house emphasizes the love and humanity that drive our mission to provide everyone with a place to call their own.

 Unity and Purpose:
Together, these elements form a logo that stands for hope, action, and the belief that every individual deserves a home filled with love and dignity.

This logo serves as a call to action, encouraging people to join us in building a brighter, more compassionate world—because when we act together, we can transform lives.
