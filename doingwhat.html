            <p>
                Our campaign is dedicated to providing safe and stable housing for children and their families. Here’s how we’re making a difference:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We provide apartments where families can live rent-free until the parents find employment.</li>
                <li>Essential supplies, including food and clothing, are covered during this transition period.</li>
                <li>Once employment is secured, families start contributing to the rent gradually, making the transition to independence smoother.</li>
                <li>Children in these families are enrolled in a school integrated within the housing complex, allowing them to study for free and grow in a stable environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together, we can create a future where every child has the opportunity to thrive and every family has a place to call home.
